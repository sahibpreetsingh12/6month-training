# 2. Custom Document Embeddings Techniques.

So this project was personally my favorite instead of using **DOC2VEC** from **GENSIM** One day I thought of Creating my own 
**DOCUMENT EMBEDDINGS**.

Implemented [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sahib12/document-embedding-techniques)

In this project I Tried to Use **TFIDF**(i.e Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency) and
**Word2vec** from **Google** I didn't Trained **Word2vec** on my Training Data(Just wanted to See the Results).

### OK What is TFIDF?
![here](PROJECT-2/tfidf.png)

These Techniques were :-

## Technique1 :-
I tried to try to use word2vec for each word embeddings in a sentences and then sum those embedding to get document embedding for that document.

## Technique 2
I used TfIdf for finding weight of each word in a document and then multiplied it to word vector created by word2vec for that word
And finally summed all word vectors to get document embedding for that document.



### Surprisingly These Techniques Got me in Top 30 % of this [Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)
